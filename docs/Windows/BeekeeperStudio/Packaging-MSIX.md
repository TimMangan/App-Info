# Packaging BeeKeeperStudio for MSIX

The software was packaged on Windows 10 21H2 using Microsoft MSIX Packaging Tool 1.2022.330 and enhanced by editing with TMEditX to inject the PSF.
* PsfLauncher is required as is the FRF.

Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mostly%20Works-yellow?style=for-the-badge).  

NOTE: This app is built using Electron, and may require additional PSF support not yet written.  This app also includes it's own copy of detours so this app is probably just a bad idea under MSIX.
