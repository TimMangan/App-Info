# Microsoft Store Package for WinSCP and Modification Package for MSIX

WinSCP offers a MSIX based package from the Windows Store.
* It is paid for, but they hope you consider it a dontation.
* The package supports migrating an existing user with their configuration intact. This is done by uninstalling the native version using the option to keep configuration data, then installing the new MSIX package.  This configuration is kept in the native windows registry.
* You can create a modification package for new users with just the registry setting inside the container.  If applied to a system with native registry settings these would override those settings.



Testing has not been performed on the Store version.
