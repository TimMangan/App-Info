# Packaging BeeKeeperStudio for MSIX

* PsfLauncher is required as is the FRF.

Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-High%20Confidence-green?style=for-the-badge).  This is because we have not yet discovered how to disable the update check.

NOTE: This app is built using Electron, and may require additional PSF support not yet written.
