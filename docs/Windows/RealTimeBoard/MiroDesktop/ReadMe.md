`Note 1`: There are two versions of the MSI, with and without autoupdates.

`Note 2`: The vendor has a free version available in the Microsoft Store.  The vendor clearly states in their online documentation that this is not fully featured.  The file is an AppXBundle file, however the packages are actually MSIX. See `App Restrictions` on vendor page: https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017572854-Desktop-app

`Note 3`: The MSI seems to install an x86 version.

## Repackaging Summary

This is where to list a summary of known success (or not) in repackaging info certain formats.  If repackaging the application is not straightforward, a specific documentation file covering the details for that repackaging format is suggested. Values in the Success field are somewhat subjective, but we recommend that the summary use the following value:

* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Full%20Fidelity-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge) - App appears to be completely functional.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-High%20Confidence-green?style=for-the-badge) - There may be a small loss in functionality, but most companies will be OK with deploying this form.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mostly%20Works-yellow?style=for-the-badge) - A loss in functionality that likely makes this a bad way to deploy.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Major%20Issues-critical?style=for-the-badge) - Application is known to not work in this form (so far).
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Work%20In%20Progress-blue?style=for-the-badge) - Work in progress.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unknown%2FUntested-lightgray?style=for-the-badge) - No information is available.
