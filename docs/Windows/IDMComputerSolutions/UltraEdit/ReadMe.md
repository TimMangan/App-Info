## Repackaging Summary

This is where to list a summary of known success (or not) in repackaging info certain formats.  If repackaging the application is not straightforward, a specific documentation file covering the details for that repackaging format is suggested. Values in the Success field are somewhat subjective, but we recommend that the summary use the following value:

* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Full%20Fidelity-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge) - App appears to be completely functional.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-High%20Confidence-green?style=for-the-badge) - There may be a small loss in functionality, but most companies will be OK with deploying this form.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mostly%20Works-yellow?style=for-the-badge) - A loss in functionality that likely makes this a bad way to deploy.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Major%20Issues-critical?style=for-the-badge) - Application is known to not work in this form (so far).
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unknown%2FUntested-lightgray?style=for-the-badge) - No information is available.

See [Testing](Testing.md) for details on the testing performed on this app.
