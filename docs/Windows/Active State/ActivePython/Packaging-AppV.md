# Packaging ActivePython for App-V

The app is easily packaged in App-V using Sequencer 2004:

* VFS Write option is needed.
* Using TMEdit to fix Shortnames is recommended; testing without this did not show any issues with the app, but the amount of testing was insuficient to rule out needing the change.

Testing on Windows 7/10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Full%20Fidelity-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge) support of the app.
