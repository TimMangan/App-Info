# Microsoft Store Package for Dbeaver and Modification Package for MSIX

DBeaver offers a MSIX based package from the Windows Store.
* It is still free.
* There is no offline license available, making it hard for internal automated distribution.
* Microsoft Store feedback indicates it might not be up-to-date, but given how often the github releases occur, it might still be reasonable.
* Microsoft Store feedback indicates feature issues.  These may be due to a lack of information/workflow to add in plugins.



Testing has not been performed on the Store version, nor producing plugin integrations of pre-configuration.
